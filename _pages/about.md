<div style="text-align: justify;">I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toulouse - Jean Jaurès. My research focuses on applying formal methods for verification and validation of cyber-physical systems. In particular, I'm interested in modeling the reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) of these systems while considering Security aspects. I am currently working on integrating human capabilities into CPS modeling with formal proof under security constraints.</div>
